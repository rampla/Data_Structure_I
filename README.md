#### MOTIVATION
When I was a child, I always liked to know how things worked. I would take my toys apart and was fascinated by what I saw inside them. Today, that hasn't changed much. Of all the systems that exist, none has captivated me as much as computing. The possibilities for building anything are endless, and the only limit is the imagination. Computing is the present, and it is building the foundations for the future.
